## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if it is worth-while opening a surf shop on the island of Oahu.

## Results
The three key aspects that we are going to look at to demonstrate the differences between June and Decemeber are Count, Standard deviation, and min/max temp.
- The min and max temps are both higher in June than in December, which is to be expected as one month is in the summer and another is in the winter. June has a min of 63 and max of 85 compared to December which has a min of 56 and max of 83. one important thing to notice is that the max temps are virtually the same, however it does get colder in December.
- The standard devation is interesting to look at because it is quite a bit larger in Demeber than in June (3.74- 3.25) what we can take away from this is that there is far more variation in the temperature during December. As can be seen above the weather is still plenty nice to be out and about. 
- Finally it should be noted that we have a higher count in June than we do in December (1700 vs 1517, for a difference of 7.4%).
