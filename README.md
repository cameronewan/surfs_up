# surfs_up

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if it is worth-while opening a surf shop on the island of Oahu based on weather data. Local legend W. Avy is counting on us. 

## Results
The three key aspects that we are going to look at to demonstrate the differences between June and Decemeber are Count, Standard deviation, and min/max temp.
- The min and max temps are both higher in June than in December, which is to be expected as one month is in the summer and another is in the winter. June has a min of 63 and max of 85 compared to December which has a min of 56 and max of 83. one important thing to notice is that the max temps are virtually the same, however it does get colder in December.
- The standard devation is interesting to look at because it is quite a bit larger in Demeber than in June (3.74- 3.25) what we can take away from this is that there is far more variation in the temperature during December. As can be seen above the weather is still plenty nice to be out and about. 
- Finally it should be noted that we have a higher count in June than we do in December (1700 vs 1517, for a difference of 7.4%).

## Summary 
Based on the analysis that we have done, it can be seen that we have a yearly tempurature at or above 70 degrees Fahrenheit with a mean difference between Dec and June of less than 4 degrees. Our data suggets that there should not be any problem with opening a location on the island of Oahu. The weather is warm enouhg to surf year round. The ice cream sales wont suffer either as the both the winter and summer months have similar max temps. 

## Additional Querry
Another aspect of the weather that W. Avy might want to consider is the amount of percipitation because if it is raining all the time it doesnt matter if it is hot people won't want tobe outside. I decided to do some analysis for him on the percipitatin levels in order to determine if it might be a problem. It can be seen that June has a mean precipitation of .13 inches while Decemeber has a mean of .21 inches. There tends to be slightly more rain in the winter months but there is not enough percipitation on avreage for W. Avy to be concerned with it affecting his sales.
